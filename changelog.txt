Changelog for Hypatia 0.2.13
============================

Hello Lovelies,

Here's what's new in 0.2.13:

    * Introduced "Contributor Code of Conduct" as code-of-conduct.adoc.
    * All resources are kept in a zip and managed through the Resource class now. Well, except for scene. I'll get to that next update.
    * Renamed "sprites" to "animations," and reflected that change in all modules.
    * Organization--moved the cycle palette and load gif from file functions to the animations module, reflected changes in various files
    * General cleaning, massive docstring updates
    * sphinx-source for auto-building api docs, also sphinx build script +make-sphinx.sh+.
    * new util module
    * fixing test.sh (was installing from pypi, not local!)
    * resolved current directory issue with tests

And who knows what else!

With Love,
Lillian
