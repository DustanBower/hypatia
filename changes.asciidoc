= What's new in this commit

  * removed old render function from render.py
  * fixed incorrect information in render.py's module docstring
  * implemented sprite/equipment anchors for walkabouts
  * implemented masks, mask-perfect collision AND anchors
  * implemented screen effect triggers with items
  * making it so each sprite consisting a walkabout can have an 
    arbitrary size with a corresponding rectangle rather than one
    rectangle for all sprites.
  * updated resources: debug walkabouts changed to wrap tighter
    around sprite
  * cleaned up code, worked on architecture, docstrings
