== Skill Sets

The more you meet the USE QUALIFIERS, the better you get at that skill/those qualifiers.

Each skill, belonging to a set, has qualifiers, points, and study effects. In addition, each skill set has a bonus effect whose base input number is: +avg(skills belonging to set)+, which must be combined with a summaritive qualifier for the skill set; this is referred to as _Base Points_.

Each skill has a bonus effect. It's input number is +avg(set's skills)+, which I'll refer to as AVG. The bonus effect activates every time a skill point is earned for that set.
