  ** Swing
  *** Sword
  *** Hammer
  * Wave/360
  * Self (Turn your char into harmful or heal)
  * Traps & Delay

furthermore, each of these base items inherit the following properties

Tags always have a parent tag, here's an example list for Stiff/Swing/Sword:
  * stiff (x1)
  * stiff/swing (x2)
  * stiff/swing/sword (x3)
  * melee/slashing (x1)

Tags have more weight the more specific it gets.
