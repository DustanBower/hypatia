Totally item-based stats.

There are item categories. You have item category proficiencies (based in "points"). Every item has a item category proficiency check.

Everyone only gets 1,000 HP throughout the game.

Some items just move faster. Some items will just deal more damage.

Each skill has an activator to gain XP for that skill. Linear leveling, so you say "At 100 points, you get perk/ability x/e.g., something is more effective or fun"

== Item Categories

=== Armor

Lower damage.

HP: absolute value. Everyone gets 1000. Defense "increases" health.
