= Item/Stat System

All items, be it single-use, equipment (weapons, armor), or whatever-else, have a corresponding parent/child tag.

A two-handed sword may have the following parent/child tags:

  * weight/heavy
  * melee/two-handed
  * melee/slashing
  * melee/sword

The more a player uses a tag, the better at that tag they are.
