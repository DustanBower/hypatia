{"name":"Hypatia Engine","tagline":"2D Adventure Game Engine","body":"![Hypatia](media/logos/logo-transparent-300x59.png \"Hypatia\")\r\n\r\nThis project is in alpha (0.2).\r\n\r\nHypatia is a game engine for single player 2D action adventure games. You can use it to make a game like [_Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages_ and _Oracle of Seasons_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages). Hypatia is aimed at non-programmers _and_ programmers alike.\r\n\r\nThere is an included demo game (`demo/game.py`). Here it is in action:\r\n\r\n![The demo game in action.](media/recordings/develop-2015-06-21.gif)\r\n\r\nHypatia is a labor of love, permissively licensed, and crafted by Lillian Lemmer. Read more about Hypatia on [the official Hypatia project wiki](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/). If you're curious about the creator, the wiki has an [about the creator of Hypatia](http://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/About-the-Creator) page.\r\n\r\n## Dive in without any programming\r\n\r\nThe included demo allows you to mess with all of its resources (see the `resources` directory!). With it you can:\r\n\r\n* Create tilesheets to make tilemaps\r\n    * Configure tiles from the tilesheet\r\n        * Chain tiles together to create animations\r\n        * Apply the \"cycle\" effect, which takes a non-animated tile, and creates an animated tile by rotating the colors used in the tile\r\n        * Set tile flags, like the +impass_all+ flag which makes a flag impassable to the player\r\n* Create tilemaps of arbitrary layers\r\n* Create scenes, with configurable NPCs, configurable scene data (player start position)\r\n* Create character sprites using animated or non-animated GIFs\r\n\r\nFor more information, please read the [official wiki guide for non-programmers](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/Nonprogrammer-Guide).\r\n\r\n## Support this project\r\n\r\n* [Donate with Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lilylemmer)\r\n* [Donate through PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YFHB5TMMXMNT6)\r\n* [Donate, or demand features in exchange for cash, through Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/hypatia)\r\n* [Donate through Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/~lillian-lemmer/)\r\n* [The creator's Amazon Wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/NKBZ0CX162S9)\r\n\r\nFor more information, please read about [the ways you can support Hypatia](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/Support-the-Project).\r\n\r\n## Dependencies, Installation\r\n\r\nIf you're using Windows, and just wanna try the demo, don't worry about this section. You can run `game.exe` from [hypatia-demo-for-windows.zip](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/raw/develop/demo/hypatia-demo-for-windows.zip).\r\n\r\nHypatia uses the following libraries:\r\n\r\n* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/)\r\n* [PygAnim](http://inventwithpython.com/pyganim/)\r\n* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/)\r\n\r\nYou should be able to install everything you need using one of the included `install-*.sh` shell scripts. It basically boils down to:\r\n\r\n1. Install Pygame (varies per platform)\r\n2. pip install --user -r requirements.txt .\r\n\r\nFor more info on installation, checkout the [installation instructions page](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/Installation-Instructions).\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nAll of the documentation is on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/).\r\n\r\nFor people, checkout the [socialization and contact methods for the Hypatia project](https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/Profiles).\r\n\r\nAdditional resources:\r\n\r\n* Official support chat: [#hypatia on Freenode (webchat!)](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hypatia)\r\n* You can contact the author via email: lillian.lynn.lemmer@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
