= Hypatia Website

This is the branch for the Hypatia website. I use a ZSH script (+makewiki.sh+) to make HTML pages from ASCIIDoc files in the +websource/+ directory.

== How to develop with this system

The +websource/+ directory contains ASCIIDoc files with the extension +.adoc+. These files are parsed with ASCIIDoc and generates HTML in the +gh-pages+ project root. Make sure to run +makewiki.sh+ in the +gh-pages+ project root.

Don't forget to +chmod +x makewiki.sh+ and you run with +./makewiki.sh+.
