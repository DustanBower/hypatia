Hypatia is a game engine for single player 2D action adventure games. You can use it to make a game like link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages[_Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages_ and _Oracle of Seasons_]. Hypatia is aimed at non-programmers _and_ programmers alike.
