The included demo allows you to mess with all of its resources (see the +resources+ directory!). With it you can:

  * link:https://github.com/lillian-lemmer/hypatia/wiki/Tilesheets[Create tilesheets to make tilemaps]

    ** Configure tiles from the tilesheet

      *** Chain tiles together to create animations
      *** Apply the "cycle" effect, which takes a non-animated tile, and creates an animated tile by rotating the colors used in the tile
      *** Set tile flags, like the +impass_all+ flag which makes a flag impassable to the player
